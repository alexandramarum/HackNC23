# HackNC23

The goal of our project was to create an app allowing multiple players to access Spotify, have Spotify pick a random song from any one of their playlists, and have the players guess who's playlist that song came from.

We unfortunately did not achieve this goal. We ran into roadblocks, ranging from the creation of a server to host our system to finding a way to allow our work in Python to communicate effectively with Swift.
Despite this, we perservered in finding solutions, and made use of our mentors. For any roadblock that truly tripped us up, we overcame three others.
